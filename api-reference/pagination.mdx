All top-level API resources have support for bulk fetches through “list” API methods. For example, you can list charges, list customers, and list invoices. These list API methods share a common structure and accept, at a minimum, the following three parameters: limit, starting_after, and ending_before.

Stripe’s list API methods use cursor-based pagination through the starting_after and ending_before parameters. Both parameters accept an existing object ID value (see below) and return objects in reverse chronological order. The ending_before parameter returns objects listed before the named object. The starting_after parameter returns objects listed after the named object. These parameters are mutually exclusive. You can use either the starting_after or ending_before parameter, but not both simultaneously.

Our client libraries offer auto-pagination helpers to traverse all pages of a list.

Parameters

limit
optional, default is 10
This specifies a limit on the number of objects to return, ranging between 1 and 100.


starting_after
optional object ID
A cursor to use in pagination. starting_after is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include starting_after=obj_foo to fetch the next page of the list.


ending_before
optional object ID
A cursor to use in pagination. ending_before is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with obj_bar, your subsequent call can include ending_before=obj_bar to fetch the previous page of the list.
