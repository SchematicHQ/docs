### Installation

The Python SDK is hosted [here](https://pypi.org/project/schematichq/). Use pip or your preferred package manager to install:

```bash
pip install schematichq
```

### Initialization

Initialize a client with an [API key secret](/quickstart#create-an-api-key).

```python
from schematic.client import Schematic

client = Schematic(
  api_key = "sch_dev_yourapikey"
)
```

### Usage example

Once the SDK is initialized, you may submit requests. Below is an example of evaluating flags.

```python
company_context = {
  "your-key-name" : "your-key-value"
}

response = client.features.check_flags(
  company=company_context,
)
```
