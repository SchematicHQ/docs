### Installation

Request access to the [NodeJS client](https://github.com/schematichq/schematic-typescript-node) by sending the Schematic team a note in Slack or by emailing `support@schematichq.com`.

Once you have been added to the private repo, set up an .npmrc entry for the private package in your app:

```
@schematichq:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Then, install using NPM or Yarn:

```bash
npm install @schematichq/schematic-typescript-node
yarn add @schematichq/schematic-typescript-node
```

### Initialization

Initialize a client with an API key secret:

```typescript
import * as schematic from "@schematichq/schematic-typescript-node";

const apiKey = "sch_dev_yourapikey"
const client = schematic.init(apiKey)
```

### Usage example

Once the SDK is initialized, you may submit requests. Below is an example of upserting a Company (creating or updating it by its keys).

```typescript
client.Companies.createCompany({
  upsertCompanyRequestBody: {
    name: "Company Name",
    keys: {
      id: "company-id",
    },
    traits: {
      status: "active",
    },
  },
});
```
