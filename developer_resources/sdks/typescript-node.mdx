### Installation

The Node.js SDK is hosted [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@schematichq/schematic-typescript-node). Use npm or your preferred package manager to install:

```bash
npm install @schematichq/schematic-typescript-node
```

### Initialization

Initialize a client with an [API key secret](/quickstart#create-an-api-key).

```typescript
import * as schematic from "@schematichq/schematic-typescript-node";

const apiKey = "sch_dev_yourapikey"
const client = schematic.init(apiKey)
```

### Usage example

Once the SDK is initialized, you may submit requests. Below is an example of upserting a Company (creating or updating it).

```typescript
client.Companies.createCompany({
  upsertCompanyRequestBody: {
    name: "Company Name",
    keys: {
      id: "company-id",
    },
    traits: {
      status: "active",
    },
  },
});
```
