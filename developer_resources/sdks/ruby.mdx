### Installation

Request access to the [Ruby client](https://github.com/schematichq/schematic-ruby) by sending the Schematic team a note in Slack or by emailing `support@schematichq.com`.

Once you have been added to the private repo, using bundler add the following line to your project’s `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'schematic', :git => "https://github.com/SchematicHQ/schematic-ruby.git", ref: '6a696ab0a98bea5312ea2447192e560d8e06ce54'
```

### Initialization

You can initialize the gem with your [Schematic Secret Key](/quickstart#create-an-api-key):

```ruby
require 'schematic-rails'

Schematic.configure do |config|
  config.api_key['ApiKeyAuth'] = ENV['SCHEMATIC_SECRET_KEY']
end
```

That will create an instance of `Schematic` that you can use to interact with Schematic. If you’re using Rails, you can place that initialization logic in `config/initializers/schematic_ruby.rb`.

### Usage example

Once the SDK is initialized, you may submit requests. Below is an example.

```ruby
schematic_keys = {}
schematic_keys["account_id"] = @user.account_id.to_s

schematic_request = Schematic::CompaniesApi.new
schematic_create_company_request = Schematic::UpsertCompanyRequestBody.new(
        keys: schematic_keys,
        name: @user.company.to_s,
        traits: nil)

begin
  result = schematic_request.create_company(schematic_create_company_request)
rescue Schematic::ApiError => e
  puts "Exception when calling CompaniesApi->create_company: #{e}"
end
```

The Ruby SDK references companies or users by their Schematic ID using the `id` key or by any key you have defined and passed to Schematic previously.
