## Setup your development

### Setting up dev and prod environments

Manage and create new environments using the environment dropdown in the top right corner of Schematic. You can create API keys for each environment indpedently in Settings.

/>

### Create an API key

Navigate to the API Keys section of your Settings page to generate your API keys. Once you create a key, an ID and a Secret will be generated. Make sure to store your Secret key in a secure place — Schematic will not display it again after it has been generated.

  src="/images/quickstart_api_2.png"
/>


**Secret Keys** are used only for server-side integrations. These keys are meant to be confidential, so they should not be used on clients.

**Publishable Keys** are used in applications and websites to submit identify and track calls, as well as perform client-side feature evaluations. They can be embedded in your application and website.

All keys are environment scoped.

## Creating companies and users

Now that you have your Schematic account set up and you have an API key, let’s set up users and companies.

1. **Add the Javascript SDK**

Let’s go ahead and make an identify call using the Javascript SDK.

<Info>ℹ️ Schematic supports several SDKs. Check them out [here](/introduction#sdks).</Info>

The schematic-js SDK is hosted here: https://cdn.schematichq.com/js/schematic.js. Copy and paste the following code into your console:

```javascript
var sch_script = document.createElement("script");
sch_script.src =
  "https://cdn.schematichq.com/js/schematic.js";
document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(sch_script);
```

<img
  src="/images/quickstart_company_1.png"
/>


2. **Initialize the Javascript SDK**

Copy and paste the following into your console and replace `your-api-key` with your [Publishable API key](https://schematic.mintlify.app/docs/quickstart#create-an-api-key):

```javascript
const schematic = new Schematic("your-api-key");
```

<img
  src="/images/quickstart_company_2.png"
/>

3. **Create a new user and new company**

Now that the Javascript SDK is initialized into the `schematic` variable, you can construct and send an identify call. Copy and paste the following into your console:

```javascript
const userId = "riF3NyX";
const userName = "Example User"

const keys = {
  userId: userId
};

const traits = {
  package: "Basic",
  company: "Example Company"
};

const company = {
  name: "Example Company",
  keys: {
    companyId: "FqaaszD"
  },
  traits: {
    package: "Basic"
  },
};

schematic.identify({ name: userName, keys, traits, company });
```

<img
  src="/images/quickstart_company_3.png"
/>

4. **Confirm the user and company were created in Schematic**

Navigate to the [Users](https://app.schematichq.com/users) and [Companies](https://app.schematichq.com/companies) tabs to verify your test call has resulted in a new User and a new Company in your Schematic account.

<img
  src="/images/quickstart_company_4.png"
/>

<img
  src="/images/quickstart_company_5.png"
/>

Identify calls are upserts, so any subsequent call using the same `keys` will update these records rather than create an entirely new one. Additionally, you may use any information stored against both objects to construct rules for feature targeting within Schematic.

## Logging events (and viewing them)

Let’s start sending Schematic events from your application.


1. **Create a new event**

Follow the steps in [Creating companies and users](/quickstart#creating-companies-and-users) to initialize the Javascript SDK. 

Once the the Javascript SDK is initialized into the ```schematic``` variable, you can construct and send a track call. Copy and paste the following into your console:

```javascript
const eventName = "query";

const traits = {
};

const companyObject = {
  companyId: "FqaaszD"
};

const userObject = {
  userId: "riF3NyX"
}

schematic.track({
  event: eventName,
  traits: {
  },
  company: companyObject,
  user: userObject
});
```

<img
  src="/images/quickstart_events_3.png"
/>

Once Features are created in Schematic, you can associate events with them in the UI or by specifying the Feature ID generated by Schematic as a trait in the event payload using ```feature``` as a key in a key-value pair.

2. **Confirm the event was created in Schematic**

Navigate to the [Events](https://app.schematichq.com/events) tab to verify your test call has resulted in a new event in your Schematic account.

<img
  src="/images/quickstart_events_4.png"
/>

Track calls can be associated with Companies, Users, and Features by specifying each when submitting a request to Schematic. Additionally, you may use events to construct rules for feature targeting within Schematic.

## Creating and checking features

The next step is to add your features to Schematic. Let’s add an example, Search Queries.

1. **Create a new feature in the Schematic app**

On the main [dashboard](https://app.schematichq.com/features), click “Create”. In the modal, add a name, description, and pick the feature type (boolean, event-based, or trait-based). It’s important to add a complete description so that other users know exactly what this feature is tied to in your application.

<img
  src="/images/quickstart_features_1.png"
/>

2. **Define a key flag**

You’ll use this key within your application to reference this feature.

<img
  src="/images/quickstart_features_2.png"
/>

3. **Attach a trait or event to the feature**

Depending on the feature type, add an event or trait to track usage and/or use while metering the feature. In this case, we'll add a `query` event.

<img
  src="/images/quickstart_features_3.png"
/>

4. **View the underlying flag to define rules**

Once you’ve finished creating the feature, navigate to the Flag tab and click the menu to "View" the flag.

<img
  src="/images/quickstart_features_6.png"
/>

Within the flag view, click “Add a new rule” and use the available criteria to build targeting rules. In this example, we’re going to use the Company criteria to target [the company we created earlier](/quickstart#creating-companies-and-users), “Example Company”. Once you’ve set up the rule, click “Review” at the top of your screen to verify you’d like the rule to be added and “Save” in the modal.

Now when checking whether this feature is available to “Example Company” within your application, Schematic will return True.

<img
  src="/images/quickstart_features_4.png"
/>

5. **Check the feature**

Follow the steps in [Creating companies and users](/quickstart#creating-companies-and-users) to initialize the Javascript SDK. Once you have, copy and paste the below into your console. 

We passed a key called “companyId” earlier when we created “Example Company”, and we can use it here so Schematic checks the feature and returns a result for “Example Company” specifically (this can also be done at the user level). Because Schematic creates user and company profiles by storing context and usage from your application and Stripe, it is not necessary to pass additional context when submitting a checkFlag request.

<Info>checkFlag accepts any key that you established at the company or user level. Alternatively, you may use the id key to refer to the Schematic ID that is generated for each company.</Info>

```javascript
await schematic.checkFlag("search-queries", { company: { companyId: "FqaaszD" } } )
```

<img
  src="/images/quickstart_features_5.png"
/>

<Info>On the client-side, checkFlag is an asynchronous Javascript function that returns a promise. Schematic supports several SDKs. Check them out [here](/introduction#sdks).</Info>

## Creating a plan and adding entitlements

Plans describes plans in your application. Let’s walk through creating a plan.

1. **Create a plan**

Navigate to the plans tab and click “Create plan”. Add name, a description, and a type.

<img
  src="/images/quickstart_plans_1.png"
/>

2. **Add an entitlement to the plan**

Entitlements can be created from the feature page or from the plan page. In this case, we'll add the entitlement from the plan page and specify how the entitlement associated with the Search Query feature should be described for the Basic plan. 

Event-based and trait-based features can have no limit, some numerical limit that is static within a period, or a limit that is dynamic based on traits that exist at the company level (e.g. some allocation that was sold directly to a given company).

<img
  src="/images/quickstart_plans_2.png"
/>

The Search Query feature can be added to other plans created in this account if we were to create them, and in each plan it may be entitled differently than the Basic plan.

3. **Target companies with an plan audiences**

Similar to how we used rules at the flag level, we can set up an audience at the plan level to add [the company we created earlier](/quickstart#creating-companies-and-users) to the Basic plan so that it receives all entitlements associated with the plan.

<img
  src="/images/quickstart_plans_3.png"
/>

In our condition, we're referring to a trait created at the company level for this audience, ```Package```. Audience conditions can be logical ORs or ANDs, but we only need one here.

We can now preview the audience to see which companies and users in Schematic match the given condition.

<img
  src="/images/quickstart_plans_4.png"
/>

Only Example Company exists within our account, and it matches the condition in the audience. Once we save the audience, Example Company is associated with this plan and will receive all of the entitlements in the Basic plan.

<img
  src="/images/quickstart_plans_5.png"
/>

More specifically, the flag check we did earlier will refer to the entitlements in the Basic plan to return a result.

A few things to note about how flag checks are evaluated:
* Companies can be associated with multiple plans as long as they match the plan audience conditions.
* If a company no longer meets the conditions of a plan audience, they will no longer be associated with the corresponding plan and lose the respective entitlements.
* Companies may have explicit entitlements that are described as "Company overrides" (not covered in this guide but can be configured on the individual company page)
* Schematic employs a permissive flag evaluation model -- in other words, if a company has entitlements, overrides, and individual flag targeting that conflict, the most permissive will prevail.
