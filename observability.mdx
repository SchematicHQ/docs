All events sent to Schematic are available in the Events tab to users. Flag evaluations are visible in the UI as they occur to determine when the evaluation occurred and how Schematic evaluated the flag.

Schematic uses external services to monitor infrastructure and alert in case of an unexpected outage. Uptime reporting is available [here](https://schematic.statuspage.io/). 

The team is on call 24/7 and can be reached either in Slack or at `support@schematichq.com`.
