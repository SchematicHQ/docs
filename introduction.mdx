## What is Schematic & how does it work?

Schematic is the only feature management platform that extends from deployment all the way through packaging. With Schematic, developers can build and release features without worrying about how they are monetized. It allows users to ship features faster, centralize data from third party tools like CRMs and billing products for precise targeting and state management, define & enforce packaging, and empower Product & Success teams.

## What can I do with Schematic?

- **Ship new features quickly and safely** - A developer experience prioritizing CI/CD, flag hygiene, and audit trails. Run Schematic in your hosting environment or access our distributed APIs.
- **Rollout features to audiences progressively** - Build company and user profiles from your application and business system data for precise rollout.
- **Tie features to plans, products, and customers** - Deploy any packaging scheme easily, with support for boolean, configuration, or metered logic. Group features into plans, and automatically manage versioning when offerings change so existing customers are not impacted.
- **Experiment, feature trials, and manage customer lifecycle** -  Empower product and success to manage per customer access exceptions, and run packaging experiments with cohorts without custom code.
- **Marry account, usage, and billing data in one place** - Integrate once with Schematic and leverage our integrations with Segment, your CRM, and your billing systems for the data you need to evaluate and set access, as well as identify trends in usage.
