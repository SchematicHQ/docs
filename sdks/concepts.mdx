## Concepts

### User and company profiles

Schematic logs all traits and events submitted via the API or client libraries, as well as data synced from third party tools such as Stripe. You can use this data to construct rules for feature targeting within Schematic.

Because Schematic creates and updates user and company profiles by storing context and usage data from your application and Stripe, it is not necessary to pass additional context when initializing an SDK.

### Keys vs. traits

Schematic uses **keys** as a unique identifier for companies and users. You can store any number of keys, however keys must be unique between each user and each company, respectively. For example, you may have a Stripe Customer ID, a Salesforce Account ID, and an application ID that correspond to an individual company. Each can be stored as separate keys that can be referenced by any tool interacting with Schematic.

**Traits** are pieces of information you may know about a user, a company, or an event. This could be metadata such as start date, renewal date, industry, employees, or role. This could also be data relevant to usage-based limits, like number of seats in use.

SDKs can reference companies or users by their Schematic ID using the `id` key or by any key you have defined and passed to Schematic.

### Verifying events

You can use the [Events](https://app.schematichq.com/events) tab to verify identify and track requests are getting to Schematic and that they are being properly associated with users, companies, and features. This is also possible in the company and user profile views.

### Environments

Schematic supports multiple environments (e.g. staging and production) and all API keys are environment-scoped. Make sure youâ€™re using the appropriate key for the environment you are working with.
