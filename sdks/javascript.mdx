### Installation

The schematic-js SDK is hosted here: [`https://cdn.schematichq.com/js/schematic.js`](https://cdn.schematichq.com/js/schematic.js). Paste the following into the `<head>` tag of your site.

```javascript
<script src="https://cdn.schematichq.com/js/schematic.js" async="async"></script>
```

The snippet will load schematic.js onto the page asynchronously, so it wonâ€™t impact page load speed. Once the snippet runs on your site, you can submit requests using your [Publishable key](https://schematic.mintlify.app/docs/quickstart#create-an-api-key).

### Initialization

Initialize the SDK with the following:

```javascript
var schematic = new Schematic("your-api-key");
```

### Usage example

Once the SDK is initialized, you may submit requests. Below is an example.

```javascript
// Send an identify event
const userId = "my-user-id";
const keys = {
  id: userId,
};
const traits = {
  anykey: "anyval",
};
const company = {
  name: "My Company",
  keys: {
    id: "my-company-id",
  },
  traits: {
    location: "Atlanta, GA",
  }
};
schematic.identify({ keys, traits, company });

// Send a track event
const event = "query";
const traits = {};
const company = {};
const user = {};

schematic.track({
  event: "query",
  traits: {
      feature: "feat_cns2asuKAG2",
  },
  company: {
    id: "my-company-id",
  },
  user: {
    id: "my-user-id",
  },
});
```

The Javasript SDK references companies or users by their Schematic ID using the `id` key or by any key you have defined and passed to Schematic previously.
